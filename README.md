# About me


**CiccioDeloitte/CiccioDeloitte** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Deloitte like an Intern.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Cloud items and tools.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on internal or external company projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with some difficult themes about IT. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about support you honestly and correctly in your work.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my email adress is fciavarella@deloitte.it
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always jokingly thought that data stored on the internet was really in the clouds, not figuratively.
